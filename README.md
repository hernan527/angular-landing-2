# Landing Page

Welcome! This is a demo landing page done with Angular 9.
I played around with API and endpoints implementation, Reactive Forms, rxjs and a couple of smart components.

## Development server

Run `npm run start:json:server` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
